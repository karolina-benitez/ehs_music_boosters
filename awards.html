        <p>
          You hear how hard it is to repeat a first place performance. Well, your Encinal Band did a three-peat on
          Saturday, October 15th at the huge Santa Cruz Band Review. Yes, it was the third year in a row we took first
          place honors in our division. And to make that more impressive, the band grew this year so we competed one
          division higher than ever before. We were in Division AA when we were always in single A before! There were 44
          high school bands there, 9 in our division.
          <br>
          Last year we had 38 musicians. This year we had 47 and thirteen in our auxiliary units for a total of 60
          members.
          <br>
          Our drum major. Opal Stanfield, placed 2nd in the military division and won a nice medal. The flag team placed
          third and won a trophy.
          <br>
          The band scored a 89.55. That score would have won division 1A, it did win 2A, it would have been second in 3A
          ( bands to 75 members), and second in 4A with bands to 90 members. I am so proud of them.
          <br>
          Our great booster parents set up a breakfast table at 6:00am for the kids. They also helped with uniform and
          hair set-up before the competition and provided a wonderful lunch after we competed. What a great group of
          support parents. Our new guard coach was there and guided the flag team in last minute preparation. GO IRIS!
          <br>
          All and all it was a wonderful, semi-wet , 16 hour long Saturday. We next compete in Napa at the Vintage Band
          Review. We have won that won the last two years also but we should also be in a larger division this year.
          Wish them luck!
          <br>
